# ⚜️ natspwns.github.io/me

Welcome to my lair on the internet. This is the code powering [my website](https://natspwns.github.io/me/) — a mildly chaotic but simple corner of the web where I talk privacy, OSINT, aesthetics, and occasionally threaten to buy another blush.

## 💻 What's this?

This site is:
- A digital business card (but cooler)
- My personal playground for cyber/DFIR/OSINT-ish things


## 🛠 Tech Stack (aka what makes this pink machine run)

- **Hugo** (the static site generator, not the fashion brand… yet)
- **GitHub Pages** (free hosting because I’m budgeting for a barista course)
- **Custom CSS/HTML sauce** for retro glam aesthetics

## 🚀 Running Locally

Feel like snooping? Here you go::

```bash
# Install Hugo (or summon it from the void)
brew install hugo  # or see https://gohugo.io if you're not in the Apple cult

# Clone and enter the repo
git clone https://github.com/natspwns/me.git
cd me
# Serve the site
hugo server -D  # D is for "drafts", or "drama"

Then go to http://localhost:1313  and enjoy the pixelated magic.
```
## ✏️ Customization Notes
If you're cloning this for inspiration or cyber rituals:

Theme is handcrafted after [ElecBrandy](https://github.com/elecbrandy)  (like a good latte)

Most of the magic happens in /layouts and /themes

config.toml holds secrets (and your baseURL, don’t forget to update it!)
